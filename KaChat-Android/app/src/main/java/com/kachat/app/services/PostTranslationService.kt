/**
 * Translation for KaPosts, X-style: a post written in another language offers a "Translate post"
 * link, tapping it swaps the text in place, and the link becomes "Translated from Spanish - Show
 * original".
 *
 * The translation itself happens on the KaChat server (see `TRANSLATION_SERVICE.md`), the way X
 * does it, rather than on the device. On-device translation - ML Kit here, Apple's Translation
 * framework on iOS - was private but cost the reader a language-pack download of tens of megabytes
 * before the first translation finished, and re-translated the same post on every device that read
 * it. A KaPost is immutable, so the server translates it once and serves that answer to everyone
 * forever. Mirrors iOS's `PostTranslationService`.
 *
 * The trade, stated plainly because the on-device design was chosen deliberately to avoid it: post
 * CONTENT is public (it is on the blockDAG), but WHICH posts a reader stopped to translate now
 * reaches the server. The request carries no identity of any kind - no pubkey, no token, no account
 * id - and the server is specified not to log bodies and to warm its cache ahead of demand, so most
 * requests are answered without a translation engine ever seeing them.
 *
 * Language IDENTIFICATION stays on the device (ML Kit's language-id, which is bundled and needs no
 * download). Deciding whether to offer the link at all is asked for every post that scrolls past,
 * and asking a server that would be a request per post.
