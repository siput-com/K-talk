 * UI model for a KaPost - mirrors iOS KaPostsView.DraftPost. Immutable: every engagement
 * change produces a new copy via [mutatePostIn], so Compose recomposition stays cheap and
 * list row identity is stable.
 *
 * `@Immutable` is a promise the class already keeps (all vals; [comments] is never mutated in
 * place, copies only). It matters for feed scroll: without it the `List` field makes the class
 * unstable, so strong skipping falls back to instance identity - and a refresh/mutateEverywhere
 * pass that rebuilds equal-content instances recomposed every visible KaPostCell. With it,
 * data-class equality lets unchanged rows skip.
