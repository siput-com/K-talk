/**
 * Periodic fallback for the continuous automatic Nextcloud chat-history sync (see
 * [NextcloudSyncService]) — every 6 hours, network connected + battery not low, its own unique
 * work. The debounced in-process upload is the primary path;
 * this worker only exists so an upload the process died before finishing (persisted dirty flag
 * still set) eventually lands. When nothing is owed it does no network work at all.
 *
 * Always reports success: a failed attempt re-marks the dirty flag inside the service, and the
 * next 6-hour cycle (or the next message's debounce) retries — WorkManager's own backoff/retry
 * machinery would only duplicate that.
