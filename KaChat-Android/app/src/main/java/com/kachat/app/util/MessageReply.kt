 * A message that replies to an earlier one — embedded as JSON directly in the same plaintext
 * content used for plain text (no separate wire type), matching the same approach [VoiceMessage]
 * already uses. Shared by both 1:1 chats and broadcast rooms: [replyToSender] is a Kaspa address
 * in both cases (the other party's address in a 1:1 chat, or the original poster's address in a
 * broadcast), and [replyToPreview] is captured at reply-creation time (a short snippet of the
 * original message, or "🎤 Audio message" if that was a voice note) so the quote still renders
 * even if the original message itself has since been deleted/pruned or its sender hidden.

     *
     * This runs on every message bubble's composition, for every visible/newly-appearing row,
     * uncached — a hot path when scrolling. A reply envelope is always small (a short reply-to
     * preview plus the reply text itself), but a photo/file message's envelope is ALSO valid JSON
     * starting with `{` (see ImageMessage/VoiceMessage) — without this size guard, every image
     * message's multi-KB-to-multi-MB base64 payload got a real Gson parse attempt here, just to
     * fail the type == "reply" check (or NPE and get caught) afterward. Scrolling fast through a
     * photo-heavy chat's history — revealing many such messages at once — made that add up to a
     * real freeze on the main thread (Compose's own layout/recomposition work competing with it).
