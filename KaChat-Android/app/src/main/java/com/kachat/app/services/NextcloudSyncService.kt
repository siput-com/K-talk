/**
 * Continuous automatic Nextcloud chat-history sync. The Nextcloud backup file
 * (`kachat-backup.json`, shared byte-for-byte with iOS and desktop) is a MULTI-DEVICE file, so
 * every automatic upload here goes through [NextcloudService.runBackup] — download what's on the
 * server, MERGE this device's history into it ([ChatHistoryExportImportService.buildBackupJson]),
 * upload the union — never a raw overwrite. A raw upload could erase another device's messages;
 * this path can only ever add.
 *
 * Triggers, all funneled through one wallet-snapshotted, mutex-serialized upload path:
 *
 *   1. **Debounced activity upload** — [ChatRepository.insertMessage] calls [noteMessageActivity]
 *      That snapshots the ACTIVE wallet, marks its
 *      archive dirty (persisted, so a killed process can't lose the fact that a sync is owed),
 *      and restarts a quiet-time timer ([DEBOUNCE_IN_CHAT_MS] with a conversation on screen,
 *      [DEBOUNCE_IDLE_MS] otherwise; the tier is read fresh each time the timer re-arms).
 *   2. **App lifecycle** — the historical `autoBackupIfDue` cadence (hourly on background, daily
 *      catch-up on foreground) is folded in here as [autoBackupIfDue]; it now uploads only when
 *      the dirty flag says something is owed (or the wallet never synced), and clears that flag
 *      on success like every other path.
 *   3. **Periodic WorkManager fallback** ([NextcloudAutoSyncWorker], every 6h, network connected
 *      + battery not low) — catches uploads the in-process paths missed because the process died
 *      first. Enqueued exactly while an account is connected AND the wallet's Automatic Sync
 *      toggle is on; disconnect/sign-out/toggle-off cancels it.
 *   4. **Remote change watcher** — while the app is FOREGROUND with an account connected and the
 *      toggle on, a Depth-0 PROPFIND polls the shared file's ETag (headers only, no body) at an
 *      adaptive cadence: every [WATCHER_POLL_IN_CHAT_MS] while a conversation thread is open on
 *      screen, every [WATCHER_POLL_IDLE_MS] elsewhere in the app.
 *      When the ETag moves, another device wrote the file: download, decrypt, and merge-import
 *      through the same additive txId-deduped import the restore paths use — silently, one log
 *      line. The last-known ETag persists per wallet and updates after every import AND every
 *      upload this device makes (automatic or manual), so a device never re-imports its own
 *      write. Together with the short upload debounce this makes two phones with their chats
 *      open a near-live mirror: a message sent on one appears on the other within seconds.
 *   5. **Automatic restore** — when a wallet becomes active with Nextcloud connected (app start,
 *      wallet switch) and when an account is first connected, the shared file (if it exists) is
 *      imported silently through the same additive, txId-deduped import the manual restore uses.
 *      Once per wallet ([restoreDoneKey], set only on a successful import; a missing file leaves
 *      it unset so a backup appearing later still restores). Skipped while any manual
 *      [BackupRestoreCoordinator] flow (restore or resync) is running, and serialized against
 *      uploads on the same mutex.
 *
 * The per-wallet Automatic Sync toggle IS the pre-existing per-account auto-backup switch
 * ([NextcloudService.autoBackupEnabled], stored scoped key unchanged) — upgraded in meaning and
 * relabeled in the UI, not duplicated. Everything else here (dirty flag, last-synced stamp,
 * restored-once marker) is a DataStore key carrying the wallet's 8-byte SHA256 hash suffix
 * ([NextcloudService.walletHashSuffix]), so account deletion can purge exactly one wallet's
 * state ([purgeStoredState]).
