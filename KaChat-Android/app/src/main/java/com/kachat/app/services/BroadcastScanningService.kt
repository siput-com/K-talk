/**
 * Scanning for broadcast messages, on-demand from two independent sources that share one
 * underlying subscription via a simple reference count — but each source only causes messages for
 * *its own* channel(s) to actually be cached, not every joined channel:
 *  1. Any channel marked "always listen" (see [BroadcastRepository.setAlwaysListen], toggled via
 *     the speaker icon next to a channel in the broadcast list) — per-channel opt-in, off by
 *     default, keeps scanning in the background for as long as at least one channel wants it and
 *     the app process stays alive. There's no separate global setting: the user picks exactly
 *     which channels stay live rather than an all-or-nothing toggle.
 *  2. [startLiveViewing] — held open by a broadcast channel screen for as long as it's on
 *     screen, so messages appear live while actively viewing that specific room even if it isn't
 *     marked always-listen. Bounded to only while that specific screen is visible.
 *
 * There's no per-address query for a public "bcast" channel — unlike normal messages, which are
 * found via the indexer's by-address lookups — so this inspects every transaction in every new
 * block via the node's block-added notification stream (see
 * [com.kachat.app.services.grpc.KaspadConnection.subscribeToBlockAdded]), matching Kasia's own
 * approach. The subscription itself can't be scoped to one channel (Kaspa transactions have no
 * concept of a "channel" at the network level, only in how the app parses payloads) — every new
 * block is inspected regardless — but [processBlock] only *inserts* a message if its channel is in
 * the always-listen set or is currently being live-viewed, so toggling one channel's speaker icon
 * doesn't silently start caching every other joined channel's messages too.
 *
 * Builds a rolling local cache of wanted channels' messages, retained per channel for up to
 * BroadcastRetention.MAX_MILLIS (user configurable per channel via the settings icon) — there is
 * no way to retroactively query the blockchain for past broadcasts (no indexer supports it, and a
 * node's block-added subscription only pushes forward from the moment of subscription), so
 * history only exists for whatever window a given channel was actually wanted (always-listen or
 * live-viewed).
