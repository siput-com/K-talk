/**
 * A tombstone marking that [contactId] was deleted (by this wallet), keyed by [deletedAt] —
 * survives the contact's own row being deleted, unlike the old "archive" flag. `syncContextualMessages`/
 * `processHandshake`/`processPayment` check this (via `ChatRepository.isTombstoned`) before ever
 * re-inserting a message or recreating a contact, so a full re-sync of that sender's on-chain
 * history (which the indexer/REST API always returns in full, not just "since last seen" —
 * `syncPayments` in particular has no per-contact cursor and re-fetches the same recent
 * transactions on every ~2s poll) can't silently resurrect a deleted conversation. A genuinely
 * new handshake/message/payment sent *after* [deletedAt] still creates a fresh contact/conversation
 * normally.
 *
 * [deletedAt] MUST be in the indexer's block_time clock domain (the max blockTimestamp already
 * seen for this contact — see ChatRepository.deleteChat), NOT the device's wall-clock time. Using
 * wall-clock time here caused a real bug: reject a handshake, then immediately re-handshake the
 * same person, and the brand new (legitimately later) handshake/reply could still get silently
 * filtered out if the device clock was even slightly ahead of the indexer's block_time — the two
 * clocks aren't the same and aren't guaranteed to agree on ordering close to the cutoff.
 *
 * [deletedAtTxIds] — comma-joined transaction/message ids that had `blockTimestamp == deletedAt`
 * at the moment of deletion (usually just one). Needed because a plain `blockTime <= deletedAt`
 * comparison isn't safe on its own: Kaspa's DAG-based block_time isn't strictly monotonic per
 * sender, so a genuinely new, different transaction sent shortly after deletion can legitimately
 * land at the exact same block_time as the tombstoned one and would otherwise be wrongly filtered
 * out forever. `isTombstoned` only treats an exact `blockTime == deletedAt` match as "old" when the
 * transaction id is also one of these — a different id at that same timestamp is treated as new.
