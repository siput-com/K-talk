/**
 * Owns a chat-history restore from tap to terminal state, independent of any screen's lifetime —
 * the Android port of iOS's `BackupRestoreCoordinator` (NextcloudService.swift). Interrupting a
 * restore midway can leave local state partially written, so the storage screens only OBSERVE
 * this singleton: the restore job runs on the coordinator's own scope (never a composable's or a
 * nav-entry-scoped viewmodel's), so recomposition, back navigation, or viewmodel teardown can
 * never cancel it. While [phase] is [Phase.Running] the storage screens present a full-screen
 * overlay (`ChatRestoreProgressOverlay` in StorageScreens.kt) that cannot be dismissed; the only
 * exits are the overlay's own Done / Try Again / Close buttons, which call back into [dismiss] /
 * [retry] here, and [dismiss] refuses to fire while a restore is running.
 *
 * Progress is real, monotonic, and stage-weighted exactly like iOS: download 0-30% (actual bytes
 * over Content-Length when the server sends it), validate 30-40%, per-conversation import 40-90%
 * (advances as [ChatHistoryExportImportService.importChatHistory] lands each conversation),
 * finalize 90-100%.
 *
 * The Danger Zone's "Wipe and Re-sync Incoming Messages" ([startIncomingResync]) runs through
 * the exact same machinery — same scope ownership, same blocking overlay, same terminal states —
 * with [kind] telling the overlay which flavor of copy to show. The wallet address is
 * snapshotted at start and every destructive/step is pinned to it, so a mid-flow account switch
 * aborts to [Phase.Failure] instead of touching the new account's data (see
 * [ChatRepository.resyncIncomingMessages]).
