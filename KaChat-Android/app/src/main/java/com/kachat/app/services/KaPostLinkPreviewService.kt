/**
 * The author and text behind a `kachat://kapost/<txid>` link, so a shared post previews in a chat
 * as the post itself rather than as a URL. Mirrors iOS's `KaPostLinkPreviewCache`.
 *
 * Resolved from the transaction the post IS - see [KaPostChainReader], which is also what makes
 * an old shared post openable at all. The author's name then comes from KNS, with a local contact
 * alias winning over it exactly as it does everywhere else in KaPosts.
 *
 * This is the one internal link that goes to the network, and it goes to Kaspa's own REST API
 * with a transaction id - never to the link's host. A pasted KaChat link is still never scraped
 * like a stranger's URL.
 *
 * Reached from composables through [Companion], because these cards render from several screens
 * with different view models and none of them owns this.
