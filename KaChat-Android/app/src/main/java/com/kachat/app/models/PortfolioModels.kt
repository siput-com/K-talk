/**
 * A buy or sell in the KAS portfolio tracker — either manually entered, or auto-imported from a
 * Kaspa address's on-chain history via "Add Kaspa Address" ([sourceAddress]/[sourceTxId] set).
 * On-chain auto-import is a deliberate, explicit opt-in: an address's transaction history can't
 * distinguish a real trade from an ordinary incoming/outgoing KaChat payment or Kaspa protocol
 * overhead like message self-stashes, so every send/receive on the address is imported as-is
 * (received = buy, sent = sell) with no attempt to filter those out — manual entry remains the
 * default, filtered-by-nothing-because-you-typed-it-yourself path, the same model CoinMarketCap's
 * own portfolio feature uses.
 *
 * Scoped per wallet address (v27->v28 migration) — each account gets its own ledger, matching
 * how contacts/messages/broadcasts/groups are already scoped, rather than mixing every
 * account's manual entries into one shared list. Rows from before the migration have
 * `walletAddress = ""`; [com.kachat.app.repository.PortfolioRepository] claims them for
 * whichever account first loads Portfolio post-upgrade.
 *
 * Further scoped within a wallet to one of up to 5 named [PortfolioEntity] ledgers via
 * [portfolioId] (v28->v29 migration). Rows from before that migration have `portfolioId = ""`;
 * [com.kachat.app.repository.PortfolioRepository] claims them for the wallet's default portfolio.
