/**
 * Whether native FCM push is currently ACTIVE for this device — meaning the server, not the
 * in-app pollers, is the notification source for the push-covered surfaces (1:1 DMs, broadcast
 * channels, KaPosts pings), per PUSH_EXTENSIONS.md §4: the app posts no banners of its own for
 * what it discovers itself while push is active.
 *
 * Foreground included. The app used to banner from both sources while on screen - the local
 * poll or scan posted, and a racing push for the same tx was collapsed by NotificationHelper's
 * txId ledger - and the seams showed: the same message arriving as two differently-worded
 * banners, or a banner whose wording depended on which path won. Every discovery path (the
 * 1:1 sync, the broadcast scan, the KaPosts poller) now returns before posting whenever this
 * flag is true, exactly as when the app is closed; discovery itself is untouched, so the data
 * is fresh when the app opens. The trade, made on purpose and the same one iOS makes: a
 * message the push service misses, or a broadcast room the server does not index, notifies
 * nothing. Unlike iOS, a device with no push at all (no Play services, registration failed)
 * keeps the local banners, because there the pollers are the only source there is.
 *
 * Set true by [PushRegistrationManager] only after a registration round-trip SUCCEEDS while
 * system notifications are actually deliverable (POST_NOTIFICATIONS granted); flipped false on
 * any registration failure, on unregister, and whenever FCM itself is unavailable (no
 * google-services.json / no Play services — registration can't succeed then, so it never turns
 * on). Consumers ([ChatRepository], [BroadcastScanningService], [KaPostsNotificationPoller])
 * consult it at their notification-posting sites, and [ChatRepository]'s 2s sync loop plus
 * [NodePoolManager]'s probe loop additionally PAUSE while the app is backgrounded and this flag
 * is true (battery: an exempted background process must not poll forever when the server is the
 * delivery path) — both resume instantly on foreground or the flag turning false.
 * Group notifications are deliberately NOT gated anywhere: group push doesn't exist (the
 * registration is the LegacyV1 shape with no watched_group_ids), so the scanners stay the only
 * source for those.
 *
 * A separate dependency-free holder (rather than a flag on PushRegistrationManager) because the
 * manager depends on ChatRepository/BroadcastRepository — the very classes that need to read the
 * flag — and Dagger can't resolve that cycle.
